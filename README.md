# Txt_AgendaBuilder
This is a version of my Agenda Builder that only outputs in .txt format

How It Works:

    Group Selection:

        Options 1–4 are prepopulated; option 5 allows you to type your own group name.

    Meeting Date:

        The meeting date is entered in YYYY-MM-DD format, then formatted as "Month Day, Year" for display.

    Unapproved Minutes Input:

        When prompted for unapproved minutes, entering 0, O, none (case-insensitive) or leaving it blank will result in "None" being added.

    Agenda Item Collection:

        The script prompts for items for each category.

    Output Files:

        Two plain text files—one for the agenda and one for the minutes—are created with a structured format.
